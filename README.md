Material for my lectures at the University of Oslo, Dec 2014

This is a 3-day course on data analysis, visualiation, & modeling within a health economics context. See a static view of the lecture material [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/OsloWorkshop2014/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb)

## Installation

To work through this material will require **Python** (either version 2.7 or 3.3-3.4) and the scientific stack, including **IPython**, **Numpy**, **Scipy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**. We'll also make use of **Seaborn** for visualization.

Currently the easiest cross-platform way of installing all of this is to use the Anaconda installer, available at http://continuum.io/downloads. To make sure you're up to date for all the above tools, install Anaconda (or [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)) and then run:

```
$ conda update conda
$ conda update numpy scipy matplotlib ipython-notebook pandas scikit-learn seaborn pip
```
